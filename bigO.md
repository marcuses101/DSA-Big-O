# Big O notation drills

## 1. What is the Big O for this?  

  ### Scenario 1  
  O(1): Constant. No matter the number of people the time complexity for finding a dog friend remains the same.

  ### Scenario 2
  O(n): Linear. Since you are asking one by one the time to ask all the people increases proportionally to the number of people.

## 2. Even or odd
  O(1): Constant. No matter the input value it will only take on iteration to complete.

## 3. Are you here?
 O(n^2): Polynomial: This function use a loop nested within another loop.

## 4. Doubler
  O(n): Linear: Time complexity increases linearly with the size of the array.

## 5. Naive search
  O(n): Linear: Time complexity increases linearly with the size of the array.

## 6. Creating pairs
   O(n^2): Polynomial: This function use a loop nested within another loop.

## 7. Compute the sequence
  This algorithm creates a fibonacci sequence. O(n): Linear 

## 8. An efficient search
O(log n) Logorithmic. With each iteration the the working size is halved.

## 9. Random element
O(1) Constant. Time complexity remains constant. Independent of the size of the array. 

## 10 What Am I?
It's checking if n is equal to 2. O(1) Constant. For loop will always only run once.

## 11 Tower of Hanoi
O(2^n) Exponential. Time complexity increases rapidly with the input size.
